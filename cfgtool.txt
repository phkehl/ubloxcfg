Serial ports:

    Local serial ports: [ser://]<device>[@<baudrate>], where:

        <device>     /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyACM1, /dev/serial/..., etc.
        <baudrate>   Baudrate (optional)

        Note that 'ser://' is the default and can be omitted. If no <baudrate>
        is specified, it is be automatically detected. That is, '-p <device>'
        works in most cases.

        It is recommended to use /dev/serial/by-path/... device names for USB
        (CDC ACM) connections as the names remain after a hardware reset and
        USB re-enumeration. See the 'reset' command.

    Raw TCP/IP ports: tcp://<addr>:<port>, where:

        <addr>       Hostname or IP address
        <port>       Port number

    Telnet TCP/IP ports: telnet://<addr>:<port>[@<baudrate>], where

        <addr>       Hostname or IP address
        <port>       Port number
        <baudrate>   Baudrate (optional)

        This uses telnet (RFC854, etc.) in-band control using com port control
        option (RFC2217) to set the baudrate on the remote serial port. This
        works for example with ser2net(8) and some hardware RS232 servers.

        A minimal ser2net command line that should work is:
           ser2net -d -C "12345:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB0: remctl"
        This should allow using '-p telnet://localhost:12345'.

Configuration layers:

    RAM         Current(ly used) configuration, has all items
    BBR         Battery-backed RAM item storage, may have no items at all
    Flash       Flash (if available) items storage, may have no items at all
    Default     Default configuration, has all items

Exit status:

    Command successful:            0
    Bad command-line arguments:    1
    Detecting receiver failed:     2
    No data from receiver:         3
    Unspecified error:             99

Command 'cfg2rx':

    Usage: cfgtool cfg2rx [-i <infile>] -p <port> -l <layers> [-r <reset>] [-a]

    This configures a receiver from a configuration file. The configuration is
    stored to one or more (comma-separated) of the following <layers>: 'RAM',
    'BBR' or 'Flash'. See the notes on using the RAM layer below.

    Optionally the receiver can be reset to default configuration before storing
    the configuration. See the 'reset' command for details.

    The -a switch hotstarts the receiver after storing the configuration in
    order to activate the changed configuration. See the notes below.

    A configuration file consists of one or more lines of configuration
    parameters. Leading and trailing whitespace, empty lines as well as comments
    (# style) are ignored. Acceptable separators for the tokens are (any number
    of) spaces and/or tabs.

    The following types of configuration can be used:

        <key> <value>
            A key-value pair to set a particular configuration parameter (item)
            to a value. The key can be the item name (e.g. 'CFG-NAVSPG-FIXMODE')
            or its ID as hexadecimal number (e.g. '0x20110011').
            The acceptable strings for values depend on the item type: Type L
            values can be converted from: 'true', 'false' or any decimal,
            hexadecimal or octal string that translate to the value 1 or 0.
            Type U and X values can be converted from decimal, hexadecimal or
            octal strings. Type I and E values can be converted from decimal or
            hexadecimal strings. For known type E and X items converting
            constant names is attempted first. Type E constants are single
            words such as 'AUTO'. Type X constants are one or more words or
            hexadecimal strings separated by a '|', e.g. 'FIRST|0x02'.

         <messagename>> <uart1> <uart2> <spi> <i2c> <usb>
            A message name (e.g. 'UBX-NAV-PVT', 'NMEA-STANDARD-GGA', etc.) and
            output rates for the listed ports. For each port a value '0'...'255'
            or the '-' character must be given to set the given rate resp.
            to not configure the rate for that port.
            This is a shortcut to using the CFG-MSGOUT-... <key> <value> pairs.

         <port> <baudrate> <inprot> <outprot>
            To configure a communication port its name ('UART1', 'UART2', 'SPI',
            'I2C' or 'USB'), its baudrate (for UARTs only, use '-' otherwise)
            and the input and output protocol filters must be specified. The
            protocol filters are space-separated words for the different
            protocols ('UBX', 'NMEA', 'RTCM3X') or '-' to not configure the
            filter. Prepending a '!' to the protocol disables it.
            This is a shortcut to using some of the various <key> <value> pairs
            that configure the communication ports (e.g. CFG-UART1-..., etc.).
            See the note on changing baudrate below.

    Example configuration file:

        # Set some navigation parameters:
        CFG-NAVSPG-INIFIX3D        true    # Want initial fix to be a 3D one
        CFG-NAVSPG-FIXMODE         AUTO    # Use automatic fixmode
        CFG-NAVSPG-WKNROLLOVER     2099    # Set GPS weeknumber rollover value
        0x20110021                 6       # = CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL AIR1
        CFG-NAVSPG-INFIL_CNOTHRS   0x23    # Require C/N0 >= 35
        # Configure UART1 baudrate, don't change in/out filters
        UART1 115200   -        -
        # Disable NMEA and RTCM3X output on USB and SPI
        USB            -        !NMEA,!RTCM3X
        SPI            -        !NMEA,!RTCM3X
        # Enable some UBX messages on UART1 and USB
        UBX-NAV-PVT        1 - - - 1
        UBX-NAV-SIG        1 - - - 1
        UBX-NAV-SAT        1 - - - 1
        UBX-MON-COMMS      5 - - - 5 # Every 5 seconds
        # Disable some NMEA messages on all ports
        NMEA-STANDARD-GGA  0 0 0 0 0
        NMEA-STANDARD-RMC  0 0 0 0 0
        NMEA-STANDARD-GSV  0 0 0 0 0

    Example usage:

        cfgtool cfg2rx -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -r factory -l Flash -a -i some.cfg

    Notes:

        When storing configuration to the RAM layer (that is, the 'current
        configuration') changes become effective immediately. This is often
        not desired. The 'correct' way to configure the receiver is changing
        the configuration in the BBR and Flash layers and then resetting the
        receiver in order to activate the changed configuration.

        This command likely fails when changing the baudrate of the port used
        for the connection in the RAM layer. This is because the receiver sends
        the success/failure result at the new baudrate. The command is therefore
        not be able to determine the result and fails. The correct way of doing
        this is outlined in the note above. A ugly and unreliable work-around is
        running the command twice.

Command 'rx2cfg':

    Usage: cfgtool rx2cfg [-o <outfile>] [-y] -p <port> -l <layer> [-u]

    This reads the configuration of a layer in the receiver and saves the data
    as a configuration file (see the 'cfg2rx' command for a specification of
    the format). Depending on the layer this produces all configuration
    (layers 'RAM' and 'Default') or only those that is available in the layer
    (layers 'BBR' and 'Flash'), which may be none at all.

    The '-u' flag adds all unknown (to this tool) configuration items as well.

    Entries in the generated configuration file are commented out if their
    values are the default values.

Command 'rx2list':

    Usage: cfgtool rx2list [-o <outfile>] [-y] -p <port> -l <layer> [-u]

    This behaves like the 'rx2cfg' command with the differnece that all
    configuration is reported as <key> <value> pairs. That is, no <port> or
    <messagename> shortcuts are generated.

Commands 'cfg2ubx', 'cfg2hex' and 'cfg2c':

    Usage: cfgtool cfg2ubx [-i <infile>] [-o <outfile>] [-y] -l <layer(s)>
           cfgtool cfg2hex [-i <infile>] [-o <outfile>] [-y] -l <layer(s)> [-x]
           cfgtool cfg2c [-i <infile>] [-o <outfile>] [-y] -l <layer(s)> [-x]

    The cfg2ubx, cfg2hex and cfg2c modes convert a configuration file into one
    or more UBX-CFG-VALSET messages, output as binary UBX messages, u-center
    compatible hex dumps, or c code. Optional extra comments can be enabled.
    See the 'rx2cfg' command for the specification of the configuration file.

Command 'uc2cfg':

    Usage: cfgtool uc2cfg [-i <infile>] [-o <outfile>] [-y]

    This converts a configuration file from u-center's 'Generation 9 Advanced
    Configuration' tool and converts it into the format cfgtool understands.
    It reads all key-value pairs in the [set] section of the input file. The
    layer tokens are ignored. Duplicate key-value pairs are silently ignored
    unless the values are inconsistent. No formal checks on the key names or
    values are performed and the data is passed-through as-is. Empty lines,
    comments as well as sections other than the [set] section are ignored.
    A maximum of 200 key-value pairs are processed. Key and value strings must
    not exceed 50 respectively 25 characters.

Command 'cfginfo':

    Usage: cfgtool cfginfo [-o <outfile>] [-y]

    This generates a list with information on all known configuration items and
    messages.

Command 'rxtest':

    Usage: cfgtool rxtest -p <port> [-o <outfile>] [-y] [-x]

    Connects to the receiver and outputs information on the received messages
    and optionally a hex dump of the messages until SIGINT (e.g. CTRL-C), SIGHUP
    or SIGTERM is received.

    Returns success (0) if receiver was detected and at least one message was
    received. Otherwise returns 2 (rx not detected) or 3 (no messages).

    Examples:

        cfgtool rxtest -p /dev/ttyUSB0
        timeout 20 cfgtool rxtest -p /dev/ttyACM0

Command 'rxraw':

    Usage: cfgtool rxraw -p <port> [-o <outfile>] [-y] [-x]

    Like 'rxtest' but not doing any auto-bauding or receiver detection.
    That is, this command dumps whatever data is received on the port.

Command 'parse':

    Usage: cfgtool parse [-i <infile>] [-o <outfile>] [-y] [-x]

    This processes data from the input file through the parser and outputs
    information on the found messages and optionally a hex dump of the messages.
    It stops at the end of the file or when SIGINT (e.g. CTRL-C), SIGHUP
    or SIGTERM is received.

Command 'reset':

    Usage: cfgtool reset -p <port> -r <reset>

    This resets the receiver. Depending on the <reset> type different parts of
    the navigation data and the configuration are deleted.

        <reset>   Navigation   Configuration   Reset
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        hot       -            -               Hardware
        warm      Ephemerides  -               Hardware
        cold      All          -               Hardware
        default   -            All             Hardware (controlled)
        factory   All          All             Hardware (controlled)
        stop      -            -               -
        start     -            -               -
        gnss      -            -               -

    Notes:

        All hardware resets cause a USB disconnect, which triggers the the host
        to re-enumerate the device. For local serial <port>s (ser://<device>)
        this is taken into account and should be handled by this command.

        The hot, warm, and cold resets use the same command as the corresponding
        buttons in u-center.

        The stop, start and gnss resets do not actually reset anything but
        instead stop, start and restart the GNSS operation.

Happy hacking! :-)
